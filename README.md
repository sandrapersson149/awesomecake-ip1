# üç∞ AwesomeCakes üßÅ
This is my first project I did on my own in school. The assignment was to make a web app using html and css. And use javascript for form validation. 

## Why not cakes?

We did not have any specific design to go after. My ide was to make a colorful site for a bakery. I found a lot of beautiful pictures on [**Unsplash**](https://unsplash.com/) and picked out the most crazy and colorful ones I could find.
